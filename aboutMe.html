<p>I am a senior at The Ohio State University studying Visual Communication Design with minors in Computer Science and Creative Writing. 
As a student, I really wanted to gain some web programming experience, so I embarked on an independent study of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
<br><br>
A personal interest of mine is the relationship between society and the digital landscape--in design, aesthetics, and attitudes toward technology.
Social media shapes the way we think and act, and it is evolving rapidly. Growing up in the 2000s and watching the iPhone's birth and social media's
adolescence, a sense of nostalgia is provoked for times when our lives weren't so dominated by screens and the worlds inside them.
I often find myself frustrated by (and equally addicted to) the control my phone has over my life, and I decided to learn more about it so I could combat it.
<br>
This project is my attempt to convey this nostalgia, peppering it with bits of insight as to why we as a society may experience such unrest when it comes to our technology.
Phones became crutches rather than tools. We have foregone any sense of playfulness and messiness the early stages of the internet were so characterized by.
As elementary as this site may be design-wise, it also best conveys the ways my mind makes sense of this ever-evolving mess. A word of advice--don't take it too seriously.
Think about where we've come from, where we are going, and who is in the driver's seat through it all.</p>
