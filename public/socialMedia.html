    <div class="box textBox" id="algorithmBlurb">Mobile phones and the Internet provide a feeling of freedom: the entire world is basically at your disposal. Infinite friends, infinite possibilities, infinite actions. It may feel like you are in control of the thing at your fingertips, but modern social media, when used improperly, ultimately takes away the autonomy of the user. We as people have become products.
